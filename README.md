#PATTERN RECOGNITION

(1st Semester Course of the MSc Data Science and Machine Learning from the NTUA)

##Description

Introduction to the theory and algorithms of statistical pattern recognition with applications to recognition of sounds 
(e.g. speech, music), visual objects, audio-visual events, and other spatio-temporal sensory or symbolic data. 
Bayesian decision and estimation theory (Maximum Likelihood, Maximum-A-Posteriori). Nearest neighbor decision rule. 
Methods for clustering (e.g. k-means) and unsupervised learning. Decision trees. Methods for feature transformation and selection in pattern space,
and dimensionality reduction: principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), independent  component analysis (ICA).
Methods for linear and nonlinear regression. Pattern classification methods with linear discriminant machines: Perceptrons καιSupport Vector Machines.
Hidden Markov models (HMMs), Gaussian Mixture models (GMMs), Expectation-Maximization algorithm, Viterbi algorithm.  Dynamic Bayesian nets.
Probabilistic graphical models.  Deep learning methods: Deep, Convolutional, Recursive Neural Nets (DNNs CNNs, RNNs). Analytic and laboratory exercises.
